#! When Traefik is configured to use the host network, it binds all andpoints
#! to all interfaces by default. This is a security risk, as it exposes the
#! internal services to the public internet. To avoid this, we bind the
#! internal services to a non-public interface.
#! We can't use localhost for this purpose, because it is not available for
#! other containers (such as metric scrapers) that are not using the host
#! network. Instead, on every node in /etc/hosts, we define a custom hostname
#! resolving to the node's IP address of the interface of our choice. Example:
#!
#!    echo 'node.k8s.lan	192.168.69.69' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
#!
#@ node_lan_host = "node.k8s.lan"
#@ node_vpn_host = "node.k8s.vpn"
